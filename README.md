# WiDS-Datathon-2021

This repo contains my solution of the WiDS-Datathon-2021 Competition  https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021/overview

The competition challenge focus on models to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus. Using data from the first 24 hours of intensive care, individuals and teams will explore labeled training data for model development. Participants will then upload predictions for unlabeled data to Kaggle and these predictions will be used to determine the public leaderboard rankings, as well as the final leaderboard revealed at the close of the competition.
